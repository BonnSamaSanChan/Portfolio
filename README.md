Project Description

This project is a character-themed portfolio webpage dedicated to Umamusume: Pretty Derby’s Symboli Rudolf. It features a responsive layout with a navigation bar, hero section, and an about section that highlights the character’s lore, achievements, and related details. The design includes a fixed background image with semi-transparent dark boxes to make text readable, as well as a framed character image styled with a pink rectangle accent. The project serves as both a showcase of front-end development skills (HTML & CSS) and a creative fan page for the character.
